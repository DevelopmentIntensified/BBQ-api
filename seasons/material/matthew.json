      "  As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.\n",
      "  Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.\n",

      "  Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.\n",

      "  The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”\n\n",

      "  Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.\n",
      "  This is why I speak to them in parables:\n\n“Though seeing, they do not see;\n    though hearing, they do not hear or understand.\n\n",
      "  In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:\n\n“‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding;\n    you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.\n",

      "  “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:\n",
      "  When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.\n",
      "  The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.\n",
      "  But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.\n",
      "  The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.\n",
      "  But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”\n\n\n",

      "  Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”\n\n\n",
      "  He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.\n",
      "  Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”\n\n",
      "  He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds[1] of flour until it worked all through the dough.”\n\n",

      "  He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.\n",
      "  The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,\n",
      "  and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.\n\n",
      "  “As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.\n",
      "  The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.\n",

      "  Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done.\n",

      "  “Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’\n\n",

      "  So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\n\n",

      "  Finally, the woman died.\n",
      "  Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?”\n\n",
      "  Jesus replied, “You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.\n",

      " When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,\n",
      "  “As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”\n\n",
      "  Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,\n",
      "  and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.\n",
      "  “But not during the festival,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.”\n\n\n",
      "  While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper,\n",
      "  a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.\n\n",
      "  When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they asked.\n",
      "  “This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.”\n\n",
      "  Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.\n",
      "  The poor you will always have with you,[0] but you will not always have me.\n",
      "  When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.\n",
      "  Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”\n\n\n",
      "  Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests\n",
      "  and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?” So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.\n",
      "  From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.\n\n\n",
      "  On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?”\n\n",
      "  He replied, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.’”\n",
      "  So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.\n\n",
      "  When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.\n",
      "  And while they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.”\n\n",
      "  They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely you don’t mean me, Lord?”\n\n",
      "  Jesus replied, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.\n",
      "  The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”\n\n",
      "  Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely you don’t mean me, Rabbi?”\n\nJesus answered, “You have said so.”\n\n",
      "  While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.”\n\n",
      "  Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you.\n",
      "  This is my blood of the[1] covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n",
      "  I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”\n\n",
      "  When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\n\n\n",
      "  Then Jesus told them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written:\n\n“‘I will strike the shepherd,\n    and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’[2]\n\n",
      "  But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”\n\n",
      "  Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.”\n\n",
      "  “Truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”\n\n",
      "  But Peter declared, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same.\n\n\n",
      "  Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”\n",
      "  He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.\n",
      "  Then he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”\n\n",
      "  Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.”\n\n",
      "  Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Couldn’t you men keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked Peter.\n",
      "  “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\n\n",
      "  He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”\n\n",
      "  When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.\n",
      "  So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.\n\n",
      "  Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.\n",
      "  Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”\n\n\n",
      "  While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.\n",
      "  Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.”\n",
      "  Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.\n\n",
      "  Jesus replied, “Do what you came for, friend.”[3]\n\nThen the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.\n",
      "  With that, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.\n\n",
      "  “Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him, “for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.\n",
      "  Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?\n",
      "  But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?”\n\n",
      "  In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.\n",
      "  But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.\n\n\n",
      "  Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.\n",
      "  But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.\n\n",
      "  The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.\n",
      "  But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward.\n\nFinally two came forward\n",
      "  and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”\n\n",
      "  Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?”\n",
      "  But Jesus remained silent.\n\nThe high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”\n\n",
      "  “You have said so,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”[4]\n\n",
      "  Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.\n",
      "  What do you think?”\n\n“He is worthy of death,” they answered.\n\n",
      "  Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him\n",
      "  and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?”\n\n\n",
      "  Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said.\n\n",
      "  But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.\n\n",
      "  Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”\n\n",
      "  He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!”\n\n",
      "  After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.”\n\n",
      "  Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know the man!”\n\nImmediately a rooster crowed.\n",
      "  Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.\n\n\n"

      " Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans how to have Jesus executed.\n",
      "  So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.\n\n",
      "  When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.\n",
      "  “I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.”\n\n“What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.”\n\n",
      "  So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.\n\n",
      "  The chief priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.”\n",
      "  So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.\n",
      "  That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\n",
      "  Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,\n",
      "  and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”[0]\n\n\n",
      "  Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”\n\n“You have said so,” Jesus replied.\n\n",
      "  When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.\n",
      "  Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?”\n",
      "  But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor.\n\n",
      "  Now it was the governor’s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.\n",
      "  At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus[1] Barabbas.\n",
      "  So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”\n",
      "  For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.\n\n",
      "  While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.”\n\n",
      "  But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.\n\n",
      "  “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor.\n\n“Barabbas,” they answered.\n\n",
      "  “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked.\n\nThey all answered, “Crucify him!”\n\n",
      "  “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.\n\nBut they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”\n\n",
      "  When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”\n\n",
      "  All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”\n\n",
      "  Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.\n\n\n",
      "  Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.\n",
      "  They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,\n",
      "  and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. “Hail, king of the Jews!” they said.\n",
      "  They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.\n",
      "  After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.\n\n\n",
      "  As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.\n",
      "  They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”).\n",
      "  There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.\n",

      "  And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.\n",
      "  Above his head they placed the written charge against him: this is jesus, the king of the jews.\n\n",
      "  Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.\n",
      "  Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads\n",
      "  and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!”\n",
      "  In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.\n",
      "  “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.\n",
      "  He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”\n",
      "  In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.\n\n\n",
      "  From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land.\n",
      "  About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli,[2] lema sabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”).[3]\n\n",

      "  The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”\n\n",
      "  And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.\n\n",
      "  At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split\n",

      "  When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!”\n\n",
      "  Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.\n",
